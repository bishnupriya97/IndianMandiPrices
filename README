This report aims to provide an overview of commodity prices in Indian Mandis (daily street market). 
The data is sourced in from NABARD (National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development), India via data.gov.in and is updated twice everyday. 
This report is refreshed everyday 6.30 PM IST. 
Please note that all states and districts do not report daily prices everyday, hence modal price (most common price) of the particular commodity 
is considered in such situations. 
All prices mentioned in the dashboard are Rs/kg
